## Survival Momma

This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24-hour hackathon project @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_>'s #40_rHASHtafaris, taking place at the 14th week of learning.

## The Idea

We were given a random song, from which the theme of our project rised. The song was "Survivor", by Destiny's Child, which was about being able to live without depending upon others. Having in mind that the world is passing through a pandemic, we ended up creating a web application that allows people to learn about the most rudimentary skills in order to survive in an isolated environment. The twist is that the users are going to learn from a very experienced person - *INTRODUCING* - SURVIVAL MOMMA - a funny old lady who has broad experience in this crazy adventure called LIFE.

## Development Process

The project was divided in sprints of four hours. We started by reading the song's lyrics and watching the videoclip. Then we brainstormed the idea for the project. Once the team was happy with the idea we put our hands to work and started to build the project structure and map the database. The group was divided into two parts: frontend and backend. The first began working on the design using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap technologies. The latter, started the project structure by creating packages, classes and their repective methods, ensuring fluid communication to the database. Through the project we joined frontend and backend using GIT.
